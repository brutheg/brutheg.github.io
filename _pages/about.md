I am currently on a research gap year at ENS Paris-Saclay. Before joining ENS, I completed my first year of a master's degree in mathematics at Gustave Eiffel University. I also hold bachelor's degrees in both mathematics and computer science from the same university. [(Full CV)](https://brutheg.github.io/files/SOUTARSON_Bruny_CV.pdf)

My research interests include signal processing and computer vision, with potential applications in the medical field. Specifically, I aim to use AI to better understand the functioning of the human brain.

Projects
======
Here are some projects I have completed.

Energy distance kernel for shape registration
------
The aim of [this project](https://brutheg.github.io/files/SOUTARSON_Bruny_TER_M1.pdf) was to assess the relevance of the energy distance kernel for shape registration, as it has been shown to reduce complexity from $$O(n^{2})$$ to $$O(nlogn)$$ in this context. However, shape registration theory relies on positive definite kernels, which is not the case here. Since this theory is intended for numerical applications, we first wanted to evaluate its relevance through a few numerical examples to determine whether its theoretical study was worthwhile.

Analysis of EEG time series from epilepsy patients
------
The goal of this project was to study the brain activity of patients with epilepsy and detect anomalies. To do this, we analyzed the electroencephalographic activity and attempted to identify spikes in the data.
